Manage classNames conditionally in React and JSX easily in **any format**

Install with npm:
```
npm install rc-classnames --save
```
Or with bower:
```
bower install rc-classnames
```

We use 	[SemVer](http://semver.org) for versioning.

## Why react-classnames
Do you remember when you wanted a button in JSX to have diffrent states conditionally? You might end up with something like this:
```js
<button className={'button' + (isDisabled ? ' button--disabled' : '') + (hasRadius ? '' : 'button--no-radius'} />
```
Or in ES6 syntax:
```js
<button className={`button${isDisabled && ' button--disabled'}${hasRadius || button--no-radius}`} />
```
Oh, It's very hard to read. But with rc-classnames those days are gone! It's intelligent! You can give it classNames in **Any Format** you want and it will generate a neat classname for you. Let's see how can we implement our button with rc-classnames:
```js
var c = require('react-classnames');

<button className={c('button', {
  'button--disabled': isDisabled,
  'button--no-radius': !hasRadius
})} />
```
Even with Arrays and Nested Arrays:
```js
<button className={c(
  ['button', 'header__button', ['button--large']],
  {
    'button--disabled': isDisabled,
    'button--no-radius': !hasRadius
  }
)} />
```
Or Arrays containing objects:
```js
<button className={c(
  'button',
  [
    'header__button',
    {
      'button--disabled': isDisabled,
      'button--no-radius': !hasRadius
    }
  ]
)} />
```
See? Give your classNames in **Any Format** you wish!
